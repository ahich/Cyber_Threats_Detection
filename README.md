Cyber threats are a growing concern for organizations worldwide. These threats take many forms, including malware, phishing, and denial-of-service (DOS) attacks, compromising sensitive information and disrupting operations. The increasing sophistication and frequency of these attacks make it imperative for organizations to adopt advanced security measures. Traditional threat detection methods often fall short due to their inability to adapt to new and evolving threats. This is where deep learning models come into play.

Deep learning models can analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns that may not be immediately obvious to human analysts. By leveraging these models, organizations can proactively detect and mitigate cyber threats, safeguarding their sensitive information and ensuring operational continuity.

In this project, we consider the dataset from [Kaggle: BETH Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/katehighnam/beth-dataset) with the following paper [BETH Dataset: Real Cybersecurity Data for Anomaly Detection Research](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~balaji/udl2021/accepted-papers/UDL2021-paper-033.pdf) explaining the data in detail.
The BETH dataset simulates real-world logs, providing a rich source of information for training and testing a model. The data has already undergone preprocessing, and the target label, `sus_label`, indicating whether an event is malicious (1) or benign (0).
We here propose to develop a very simple model, with the goal of enhancing cybersecurity measures and protecting organizations from potentially devastating cyber attacks.
With a simple Deep Learning model, we are able to identify threats with an accuracy, precision and recall of 100%, 100% and 95%, respectively.
